# DeadlineTgBot

### The essence of the program 
The program runs a telegram bot on the machine, which monitors the deadlines of telegram users. You can contact the bot and create a deadline - come up with a name and time. The bot will automatically send SMS to private messages or a group in a week, in three days and in one day. At the same time, each user has his own list of deadlines, which he can view with the appropriate command. You can also customize the appeal to the bot by adding words that will be convenient to use, or, conversely, delete unnecessary ones. The bot is also able to delete the selected number of SMS messages between him and the interlocutor from the conversation, in order not to clog up the correspondence.
